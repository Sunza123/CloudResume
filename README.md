# CloudResume
I plan on hosting this on an AWS instance eventually. This is still a rough draft and only hosted locally in my lab.

TODO:

-add contact information and update contact link in nav bar

-create a visiter counter to keep track of how many visiters

*Disclaimer: I am not a front end dev and I'm figuring this out as I go along. If there any issues with my code I would be happy to take constructive critisism.
